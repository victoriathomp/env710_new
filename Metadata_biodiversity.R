#Description:
#The study was conducted within nine reach-pair sites located within the McKenzie River Basin 
#in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Seven of the sites were located within the HJ Andrews 
#Experimental Forest (HJA), a 6,400 ha research forest encompassing the entire Lookout Creek drainage
#basin. Cook Creek and Fritz Creek were located outside of the HJA. Cook Creek is a tributary of Blue
#River upstream of Blue River reservoir and Fritz Creek is a tributary of Deer Creek, which flows 
#directly into the McKenzie River.

#Each pair consisted of two reaches: one within a section of stream with old-growth riparian 
#forest, and another in a nearby section of stream bordered by second-growth riparian forest on 
#at least one stream bank. Harvesting in the previously managed reaches occurred on just one stream 
#bank in three reach pairs (MR404, LO701, and LO703) and on both banks for all other pairs. Sites 
#were selected based on the presence of old-growth and second growth riparian forests close in 
#proximity on the same stream (within 500 m). Having distinctly different forest types along two 
#nearby sections of the same stream reduces inherent stream-to-stream environmental variability 
#(e.g. temperature, gradient, geology, substrate, etc.) that often arises in comparisons between 
#whole-stream systems in basins with managed versus unmanaged, late succession forests. Reaches 
#ranged from 90-200 m and reaches within a reach pair were separated by a 90-325 m buffer section.

#Metrics of habitat and productivity relative to fish and salamander biomass in nine stream reach 
#pairs were collected. Considering differences among streams and between reaches within each stream, 
#relationships between both biotic and abiotic covariates and the biomass of coastal cutthroat trout 
#(Onchorhynchus clarkii clarkii), coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) and total vertebrates
#(fish and salamanders) were evaluated.

#Five of the six fish-bearing stream reach pairs originally surveyed by Murphy and Hall (1981) were 
#visited to determine how stream conditions, benthic biofilms, invertebrate predators, and ultimately 
#resident coastal cutthroat trout have responded to nearly four decades of riparian forest regeneration.
#Using the upstream reference reaches identified by Murphy (1979), which were bordered by old-growth 
#riparian forests, this design is similar to a before-after control-impact study with riparian regeneration
#as the treatment. The same study reaches were sampled and evaluated how 40 years of riparian regeneration
#influenced our response variables.
  
  
#SITE DESCRIPTION:
#The previously harvested cutblocks were cleared 40-60 years prior to this study. In all cases,
#timber was removed down to the stream bank with no riparian buffer. Trees were replanted 
#within 5 years post-harvest in seven of the nine cuts in accordance with forest management 
#practices at the time. Stands in MCTW and Mack Creek were regenerated without any post-harvest
#planting. In 2014, the second growth riparian forests were predominantly Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga 
#menziesii) but red alder (Alnus rubra) was also a common canopy species in areas directly adjacent 
#to streams and provided substantial stream shading. Old-growth forests were comprised of Douglas fir,
#western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata). Red alder was present 
#adjacent to streams within old-growth forests as well, but it was not as common as in second 
#growth sections.

#Coastal cutthroat trout and coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) were present in
#all 18 stream reaches and were the dominant vertebrates. Sculpin (Cottus spp.) were present in
#both reaches of MR404, but were not found in any other reaches. Tailed frogs (Ascaphis truei) 
#were found in low abundance in some of the streams, but were not evaluated in this study.


#Description of distinction between old-growth and second growth study reaches:
#COOK - Cook Creek, a tributary of Blue River upstream of Blue River reservoir and north of 
#the HJ Andrews 
#FRITZ - Fritz Creek, a tributary of Deer Creek, which flows directly into the McKenzie River, NE of the HJ Andrews
#LO701 - Harvest block LO701 on Lookout Creek. Second growth section was in cutblock of LO701. The downstream end of this reach was 180 m upstream of the cutbreak. The old-growth section was downstream of cut LO701. The upstream end was 75 m downstream from the cutbreak.
#LO703 - Harvest block LO703 on Lookout Creek. Second growth section was in cutblock of LO703. The downstream end of this reach was 85 m upstream of the western edge of cutbreak LO703. The old-growth section was upstream of cut LO703. The downstream end of the reach was 50 m upstream from the eastern edge of cutbreak LO703.
#MACK - Mack Creek. This site is part of an LTER fish study.
#MCT_E - McRae Creek east tributary . Second growth section was in cutblock of L504. The old-growth reach was upstream of the second growth reach here. The upstream end of the second growth reach was 200 m downstream of the cutbreak. The downstream end of the old-growth section was 35 m upstream of the cutbreak.
#MCT_W - McRae Creek west tributary. Second growth section was in cutblock of L503. The downstream end of the second growth reach was 90 m upstream of the cutbreak. The upstream end of the old-growth section was 50 m downstream of the cutbreak.
#MR404 - Harvest block L404 on McRae Creek. Second growth section was in cutblock of L404. The downstream end of the second growth reach was 110 m upstream of the cutbreak. The upstream end of the old-growth section was 80 m downstream of the cutbreak.
#STR - Harvest block L504 on McRae Creek. Second growth section was in cutblock of L504. The old-growth reach was upstream of the second growth reach here. The upstream end of the second growth reach was 75 m downstream of the cutbreak. The downstream end of the old-growth section was 75 m upstream of the cutbreak.
