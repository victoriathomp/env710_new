Description:
#The study was conducted within nine reach-pair sites located within the McKenzie River Basin 
#in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Seven of the sites were located within the HJ Andrews 
#Experimental Forest (HJA), a 6,400 ha research forest encompassing the entire Lookout Creek drainage
#basin. Cook Creek and Fritz Creek were located outside of the HJA. Cook Creek is a tributary of Blue
#River upstream of Blue River reservoir and Fritz Creek is a tributary of Deer Creek, which flows 
#directly into the McKenzie River.

#Each pair consisted of two reaches: one within a section of stream with old-growth riparian 
#forest, and another in a nearby section of stream bordered by second-growth riparian forest on 
#at least one stream bank. Harvesting in the previously managed reaches occurred on just one stream 
#bank in three reach pairs (MR404, LO701, and LO703) and on both banks for all other pairs. Sites 
#were selected based on the presence of old-growth and second growth riparian forests close in 
#proximity on the same stream (within 500 m). Having distinctly different forest types along two 
#nearby sections of the same stream reduces inherent stream-to-stream environmental variability 
#(e.g. temperature, gradient, geology, substrate, etc.) that often arises in comparisons between 
#whole-stream systems in basins with managed versus unmanaged, late succession forests. Reaches 
#ranged from 90-200 m and reaches within a reach pair were separated by a 90-325 m buffer section.

#Metrics of habitat and productivity relative to fish and salamander biomass in nine stream reach 
#pairs were collected. Considering differences among streams and between reaches within each stream, 
#relationships between both biotic and abiotic covariates and the biomass of coastal cutthroat trout 
#(Onchorhynchus clarkii clarkii), coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) and total vertebrates
#(fish and salamanders) were evaluated.

#Five of the six fish-bearing stream reach pairs originally surveyed by Murphy and Hall (1981) were 
#visited to determine how stream conditions, benthic biofilms, invertebrate predators, and ultimately 
#resident coastal cutthroat trout have responded to nearly four decades of riparian forest regeneration.
#Using the upstream reference reaches identified by Murphy (1979), which were bordered by old-growth 
#riparian forests, this design is similar to a before-after control-impact study with riparian regeneration
#as the treatment. The same study reaches were sampled and evaluated how 40 years of riparian regeneration
#influenced our response variables.
